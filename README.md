# Language Learning App

## Overview
This is a SwiftUI application designed to help users learn foreign languages using a card-based approach. The app allows users to create and manage language learning resources through a common GitHub repository. Users can input their own language resources and switch between them seamlessly.

## Features
- **Card-Based Learning**: Users can view cards that display words and their translations, helping with memorization and writing.
- **Customizable Categories**: Users can create and manage categories of words, such as Family, Kitchen, and Travel.
- **Multiple Language Support**: Users can input URLs for their base language and the language they wish to study.
- **Progress Tracking**: The app keeps track of user progress and allows for repeated practice.
- **Offline Access**: Downloaded resources are available offline, including images and JSON files.
